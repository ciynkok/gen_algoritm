# Using Genetic Algorithm to Solve the Traveling Salesman Problem

## A project written in C++ that implements a genetic algorithm for finding the optimal path

This project includes two modules, the first module is a for generating the traveling salesman problem, and the second module is a genetic algorithm that searches for the optimal path. The traveling salesman problem is represented as a set of coordinates (x, y) and a matrix of distances between these points.
